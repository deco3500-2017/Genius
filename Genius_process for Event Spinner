After a group meeting, we officially decided to change the idea of our previous mobile software into spinner. Our initial idea is:

Separate the area on the dial, and then provide different songs and names for each area. When the user turns the dial, the name of the song provided by the arrow pointing to the area is the subject that the user can describe his own story or show talent.

But we found that the original idea of a lot of problems, such as:
1. What happens if the user is getting an unfamiliar song?
2. If there is no classification, all the music is random, so there will be no clear theme.
3. What type of turntable (physical turntable or electronic turntable?)
4. How can the elderly get together to carry out this activity?
5. What are the specific functions on the turntable?
