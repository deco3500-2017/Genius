### Problem Domain
Music offers a multitude of benefits for people of every age, particularly for the elderly population. It works as a therapy to increase memory function, relax the body, reduce muscle tension and boost productivity. Our idea is to create a music app, especially for elders to help them listen to music and share their experience with the people. Along with the app, we have created a spinner to help elders to meet people.It helps them recover from loneliness. Sharing stories with others gives them courage to live life when they feel being accepted and respected.Recalling memories with music can thus help them recover their speech and also overcome dementia by recalling music and stories. Singing and recording  music will  allow self-expression by sharing that with their community. The other users of the app could be the listeners who like old songs. For elders listening to music can relieve them from boredom. While listening to music, tapping the foot or clapping with rhythm encourages movement. The other benefit that can be reaped is creating a large social network and recalling and sharing stories associated with the songs.Our idea to create app that help elders listen to music and create events to meet people to share stories related to the music and listen to others.



### Demographic
Most developed countries have accepted the chronological age of 65 years as a definition of 'elderly' or older person. The United Nations has agreed that 60+ years may be usually denoted as old age and this is the first attempt at an international definition of old age. For the study of old age in Africa, the World Health Organization set 50 as the beginning of old age. However, the definition of seniors is slightly different among developing countries and developed countries according to the Wikipedia (En.wikipedia.org, 2017).In additor,the majority of developed-world countries have agreed that senior citizens are those people with the chronological age of 65 years while citizens with age 60+ will be considered as seniors in most developed countries.At the same time, the WHO recognized that the developing world often defines the old age, not by years, but by new roles, loss of previous roles, or inability to make active contributions to society. (En.wikipedia.org, 2017)

Based on this situation, the application MusicLife will use Australian senior definition as our target audience group which is people with the age of 60+ and do not work full time.To narrow down the demographic,we decieded to add more specific attributes to the group such as hobby and intrest.To sum up,our target audience would be those retired people who is at the age of 60+ enjoy sharing personal and music experience with strangers.

The functions are related to each other in the app. One needs to listen to the music under their selected mood. The more tab under the songs will display the events related to that music. Join event tab is also under the song.If they do not find any event of their interest and wish to create their own, that function is available in that particular song. The following diagram shows how functions are related to each other:



***What information needs to be available?***Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  

**Data required to perform task:**

Data required to run the app: The most important data is music. Various music of interests and particularly that had been famous at least 50 years ago. Selection of songs should be such to trigger memories or inspire elders to say something. Music has to be from most of the categories that had been in trend and famous during our their time. Most of the memories are from childhood, young age, when they got married, had kids or grand children.So songs have to be during that era from all those occassions.

**How are data transformed by system?**

Initial data is the Music that must be updated in the app time to time . 
The app needs to take the location of the elder to search for events near them.
The app sends data like name, song to the Spinner.
Spinner displays names of the person attending event together and help them in talking turns.
Â  Â Â Â  
**Form of the solution**
MusicLife app will be an interactive app with icons, menus and clear text on Pages that can be swiped to navigate through app.
Spinner has easy touch interactions to play music, record and play voice about stories and like the stories.

Level of user support - App and spinner both are simple and easy to use. Elders won't be required to learn something new. The buttons are similar to the existing apps and interactions.

Activity to be supported -Helping elders to come together share their emotion and stories with particular song.

**Focused Groups:**
*Elders above age 60:*
There have been numerous music apps available but that have not been designed in keeping in mind that elders do have health related issues that can make it difficult for them to use those apps. We try to find out what difficulties do they find and what features would they like to be implemented in Music app.

*Elders living apart from Family:*
Our main focus is to let elders share their music and memories with their families and friends. Most of the elders are found living apart from families. We want to provide them a platform to share their Memories and stories with a particular song with their families and friends and stay connected. Elders feel loved when someone listens and appreciates them. Also recalling memories help them overcome Dementia.Music can trigger long forgotten memories and reduce anxiety. Music has been proven to promote better health and a higher level of functioning.

*Elders who like music:*
We need to test music apps with the group of elders who are fond of music and can be the potential users. Elders who like music will possibly be using some source of Â music and can help us understand their needs and problems they have been facing in the current app or devices.

*Elders who are currently using Music Apps:*
As we are required to design app , we must know what apps are being used by our elders and what do they like or hate about their current apps. This will help us know the layout, features and design properties they are comfortable with.
