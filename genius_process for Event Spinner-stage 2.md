After a group meeting, we officially decided to change the idea of our previous mobile software into spinner. Our initial idea is:

Separate the area on the dial, and then provide different songs and names for each area. When the user turns the dial, the name of the song provided by the arrow pointing to the area is the subject that the user can describe his own story or show talent.

 We found that the original idea of a lot of problems, such as:
1. What happens if the user is getting an unfamiliar song?
2. If there is no classification, all the music is random, so there will be no clear theme.
3. What type of turntable (physical turntable or electronic turntable?)
4. How can the elderly get together to carry out this activity?
5. What are the specific functions on the turntable?

In the new round of panel discussions, we discussed these issues and made decisions.
- make a physical turntable
- we can make this turntable in the form of a game activity. Creator selected theme, such as: anger, happy, memorable, regret and so on.
Then according to each theme, the turntable can offer a variety of different music.
About a fixed time and place, the elderly can sit around the turntable, when the arrow refers to a user, 
the user can start with other people to share their own stories or show talent.
- If the user is not familiar with or no story can share the song, you can turn the turntable, to a new round of choice.

We found a problem with this new idea, that is the limitation of this activity. If you want to design a physical turntable, then it means that this activity can not start anytime, anywhere.
Through group discussions and research, we come up with a very interesting improvement:
we can use the mini projector to project the turntable. You can use SONY mini projector to carry out the design of the turntable.

Here is the link for our inspiration:

 Our team agreed that if the project can use the projector to do our project, you can make this event unlimited time and place, 
as long as there are lights can achieve this activity.

If you want a remote control, on the remote control only need has an ON / OFF button and one big button on the center of the remote control.projection infrared pencil is a good idea for our project.So the user can use this pen to select the different options on the spinning wheel.

Our group drew a rough sketch for the spinning wheel.
Section E: all the topics, such as: happy, sad, unforgettable etc.
Users can use controller to make the center spinning to rotate first and then locked on a topic.Section A, B, C, D: is another spinning wheel, once the user chooses the main topic, then rotate this spinning again, 
to lock on one music to start to tell own story about this song.
Section A: music name
Section B: upload the image
Section C and D: C is a big button "YES", D is a big button "NO".


 (According to our group discussion, it just starting a new idea, but just change the way of sharing based on providing a physical event or activity）

- The following step might just be doing some user testing like interview to ask the users about will they prefer sharing music at a physical location with strangers or online.
And will this app help to remind their stories this kind of stuff. 


After a user test, we got a lot of useful user feedback. In communication with the tutor and discuss, we know how our next step should be to improve our equipment.
In the interview to the three old people, they are on the appearance of the spinner design are more satisfied, 
but the elderly hope that if more makes the interface more concise will be better.
User feedbacks

In the interview to the three old people, they are on the appearance of the spinner design are more satisfied, but the elderly hope that if more makes the interface more concise will be better.

"I like the spinner of your design, but it is better if you can be more concise, such as the area on each part of the keyboard is too much."

design concept

The old people expressed a high interest in our idea, and they expressed their willingness to participate in the spinner. But at the same time, they also have some confusion about this design. For example, if the choice of songs is not what they are interested or familiar with how to do? How do I join this event? 
Is it necessary to register or join?

"Your idea is very interesting, but in my opinion, I do not really understand how you achieve these functions." "I think your design needs to be perfect because a lot of content makes me feel there is room for improvement and possible." "Interesting but also confuse."

Functional design

Our group's original design concept is to use the mini project to project the spinner; the idea can make the elderly anytime, anywhere in any occasion to use. But the old man does not like the idea very much.

"I would prefer to be able to touch the physical device, such as mahjong, poker, and so on, compared to the projector." "The physical equipment will make me more comfortable to use." The projector make me feel that the operation is not particularly comfortable.



Summary

According to the testing result we collected,the spinner idea is working as most of the seniors thought the idea is interesting and expressed a willingness of try.
As the spinner is physical and it is a normal daily item,seniors indicated that they feel more comfortable while using it.However,the idea of the spinner concept is not perfect and it lacks of details which result in confusions.To implement the spinner concept better,some of the seniors suggested to simplify the spinner interface.For example,
is it neccessary to include the songs in the spinner because therehave some possibilities that seniors are not interested at the provided song.In addition,elderlys dislike complex applications and it's important for the team to consider about how to make both of application and spinner easy to use and navigate.

- Based on all the feedback, we made further changes. And improved the appearance of the turntable, 
making the whole turntable becomes more simple, easy to operate.
