# Spinner
Spinner can be seen as an interface allowing elders to take turns. Spinner make partitions depending upon the people attending event.Each partition is allocated to each participant. Music gets updated into Play Music place at spinner. This is the music that got uploaded when they joined event. On a spinner is a hand ,similar to clock hand, that helps in turn taking. On turn, elder can choose to play music,record their stories or their own music and on playing recording , they can hear it again and again and also get uploaded on their app.Video on how it works can be found here:
