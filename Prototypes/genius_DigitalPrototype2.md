### Updating Prototype ###
![event interface](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/Genius/blob/master/DigitalPrototype/eventprototype.jpeg)

In our discussion of the group, we decided to simplify the function of this turntable. So remove some of the cumbersome options and details. This makes it easier for older people to use.

 ## User feedbacks
 ![testing](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/Genius/blob/master/testingatagecare)
 The testing session was held at Estia Health Gold Coast with three adults og age 72,80 and 85. All of them were given app to interact and then the spinner to play with. I explained them the aim of our project but didnot explained the meaning of buttons and images used in our interface design to see if they can understand by themselves without explaining. The results gathered have been listed below: 
 Interface design
 The spinner was very simple and clear to them. They all enjoyed playing music, recording their voice and then playing it. They all believed that it was easy. The labels make sense and create no confusion. The like button is obvious to like others stories or music.Play music plays music and like in radio they press same button to turn on and off. They enjoyed interacting with it physically . I asked them what if it has been projected on a wall and they have to select using a device. They all said that they are not very keen to learn new technology.They want to do something that looks familiar and does not involve learning.
 
 App was though little confusing.One of them suggested to remove the features of uploading  images and videos as it will again involve learning to first save them in mobile and then  uploading it. She suggested that during event they can bring along and show it to all.
 
 Also , taking turns on spinner was not clear to them. One of them suggested to display the name on spinner for turn taking. When booking for event, we input our name ,that name should be displayed on spinner.
 
In the interview to the three old people, they are on the appearance of the spinner design are more satisfied, but the elderly hope that if more makes the interface more concise will be better.

"I like the spinner of your design, but it is better if you can be more concise, such as the area on each part of the keyboard is too much."

design concept
The old people at Estia Age care meet during morning time everyday or during movie time. Generally during morning tea they do some art work and chat with each other. This concept was new and interesting to them.they expressed that sometimes it is hard to keep conversation going but as everyone love music ,we never thought to include it in our get togethers. Also listening to others  stories encourages them that they are respected and cared for. 

The old people expressed a high interest in our idea, and they expressed their willingness to participate in the spinner. But at the same time, they also have some confusion about this design. For example, if the choice of songs is not what they are interested or familiar with how to do? How do I join this event? Is it necessary to register or join?

"Your idea is very interesting, but in my opinion, I do not really understand how you achieve these functions."
"I think your design needs to be perfect because a lot of content makes me feel there is room for improvement and possible."
"Interesting but also confuse."

Functional design

Our group's original design concept is to use the mini project to project the spinner; the idea can make the elderly anytime, anywhere in any occasion to use. But the old man does not like the idea very much.

"I would prefer to be able to touch the physical device, such as mahjong, poker, and so on, compared to the projector."
"The physical equipment will make me more comfortable to use." The projector make me feel that the operation is not particularly comfortable.

## Summary
According to the testing result we collected,the spinner idea is working as most of the seniors thought the idea is interesting and expressed a willingness of try.As the spinner is physical and it is a normal daily item,seniors indicated that they feel more comfortable while using it.However,the idea of the spinner concept is not perfect and it lacks of details which result in confusions.To implement the spinner concept better,some of the seniors suggested to simplify the spinner interface.For example,is it neccessary to include the songs in the spinner because therehave some possibilities that seniors are not interested at the provided song.In addition,elderlys dislike complex applications and it's important for the team to consider about how to make both of application and spinner easy to use and navigate.
