### Questions
Before we could start creating Music app for elders , we decided to interview elders to find out their views about the app. Also to aid us in designing, we needed to find out what technology and app they are currently using .Followings are the questions we asked in the first interview and first prototype:
* Do you have any mobile devices?
* How will you utilize your devices? Will you use it to listen to music?
* Do you like listening to music?
* How often do you use your phone to listen to music?
* How long do you listen to music per day?
* What type of music do you like?
* What platform will you use for approaching music?TV,radio or smart phone?
* How do you think of this design?Is it easy for you to use it?
* For the sharing page,what will you design to make the process more clearer?
* What is your most favourite music application and state why.
* Do you like to share music with others? If yes, when you sharing the music, what kind of message are you trying to deliver?
* What kind of music application you preferred? Why?
* What is your favourite song?
* Do you have children? Do you have same listening topic or interest with them?
* How do you want to share music? Record? Listening? Or repost others?


### Result
*Result 1:* 
Xu,a 65 years old lady born in Hong Kong but living in Brisbane for more than 30 years.She has a smart phone but she only used for texting and making phone calls only because she only gets 3GB data monthly and she doesn't want to pay extra money for downloading online music.She doesn't like music but she has a CD player at home.She only listens music when she's in the church with her friends and she only listen to carols.She indicates current design for the application is good as big buttons and big text are using and it's a good idea to have only one post each for the music sharing page.But she suggested to using some icons along with the text for buttons.

*Interview 2:* 
Liang,a 72 years old lady,doesn't has any mobile devices.She enjoy going to church and talking with other people at the weekend.She loves music but she only listen to carols and she has a huge collection of CDs at her place.She like the current interface design because the big button and big text is obiviously and she can understand how to use easily.However,she would prefer some applications that are easy to navigate and she doesn't care how fancy the interface would be unless she knows how to use it. In addition,Liang isn't good at English and she would prefer to use some application that provides language settings.


## Result Summary
Based on our prototype and interview , we have found that elders do not like to use complex apps and avoid using devices and apps that involves too many interactions. They do have stories related to music which triggers when particular song is playing but haven’t found any platform that lets them share that with their friends and families staying apart. So our aim is to develop an app with the following considerations in mind:

* Using larger font size and clear interface. Seniors avoid to use apps that has complicated interface and it makes hard to look at. In other words, they don’t need the interface has good looking, they can stay the interface as clear as it can.
* Icon should be used with text when designing buttons and emoji should not be used as it might cause some confusion.
* One song per page for viewing post.Elderly prefer to choose a song per page rather than a list. By which they mean little details associated with it and may be little part of song than just the name of the song.
* Avoid to  scroll a list.
* No need for downloading music as seniorsdo not have enuoght patience.
* Design should be classic rather than being modern so that they know how to use it easily.
* They want the app has multi language option.
* The interface metaphor must as clear and accurate as it can, otherwise it will confuse them.
* App that allows to record and share .
* App that does not require too much interactions playing music.
* Auto Playlists is required.
