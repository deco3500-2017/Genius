She uses smartphone to call , facebook and play games . She likes playing games that involves drag and dropping and thus do not like playing on desktop. She cannot sit for long time thus likes using mobile as it can be used anywhere , anytime and anyway.She likes listening radio.

Currently , he has been using skype to share his cooking with grandchildren.Also , suggested to put options that enable us to select from various option rather than inputting text.



## Requirements
Based , on our  research , we have found that elders do not like to use complex apps and avoid using devices and apps that involves too many interactions. They do have stories related to music which triggers when particular song is playing but haven’t found any platform that lets them share that with their friends and families staying apart. So our aim is to develop an app with the following considerations in mind:

* Elderly prefer using larger font size and clear interface. They avoid to use apps that has complicated interface and it makes hard to look at. In other words, they don’t need the interface has good looking, they can stay the interface as clear as it can.
* Icon can help them use the app more efficient. (icon not emoji) 
* Elderly prefer to choose a song per page rather than a list. By which they mean little details associated with it and may be little part of song than just the name of the song.
* Avoid to  scroll a list.
* They do not have patience to download a song.
* They want some apps that is classic, apps found today are  too modern for elderly.
* They want the app has multi language option.
* The interface metaphor must as clear and accurate as it can, otherwise it will confuse them.
* App that allows to record and share .
* App that does not require too much interactions playing music.
* They like Auto Playlists.
