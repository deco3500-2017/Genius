# Introduction
This is an improved version developed based on the feedback from testings on prototype 1 and 2. Based on Feedback from previous test results, this prototype lets elders share their stories and experiences face to face. It gets too complicated for them to share online and also does not inspire a lot sharing and thus does not cheer them up too.This prototype helps them join other people, talk too them , share their experiences, listen to music together and share stories with each other.As people of same mood gel along, they all motivate each other. If you feel others pain. you try to encourage them and so does the others. Everyone listen to each other and try to motivate each other thus helping each other growing emotionally and socially.

## Testing results
![testing](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/Genius/blob/master/testingatagecare.png)
 The testing session was held at Estia Health Gold Coast with three adults og age 72,80 and 85. All of them were given app to interact and then the spinner to play with. I explained them the aim of our project but didnot explained the meaning of buttons and images used in our interface design to see if they can understand by themselves without explaining. The results gathered have been listed below: 

### Interface design
 The spinner was very simple and clear to them. They all enjoyed playing music, recording their voice and then playing it. They all believed that it was easy. The labels make sense and create no confusion. The like button is obvious to like others stories or music.Play music plays music and like in radio they press same button to turn on and off. They enjoyed interacting with it physically . I asked them what if it has been projected on a wall and they have to select using a device. They all said that they are not very keen to learn new technology.They want to do something that looks familiar and does not involve learning.
 
 App was though little confusing.One of them suggested to remove the features of uploading  images and videos as it will again involve learning to first save them in mobile and then  uploading it. She suggested that during event they can bring along and show it to all.Also , taking turns on spinner was not clear to them. One of them suggested to display the name on spinner for turn taking. When booking for event, we input our name ,that name should be displayed on spinner.

### Concept Idea
The old people at Estia Age care meet during morning time everyday or during movie time. Generally during morning tea they do some art work and chat with each other. This concept was new and interesting to them.they expressed that sometimes it is hard to keep conversation going but as everyone love music ,we never thought to include it in our get togethers. Also listening to others  stories encourages them that they are respected and cared for. 

## Feedbacks from Standups
* Current prototype design doesn't look like an actual product and looks more like an application mockup as no examples are given.For example, it displays "xxx" at the event page and it's hard to understand the concept without the explanations.
* This application is related to music but music content has hidden so deep in the application.The application is more like an event platform rather than a music application.

## Summary
The overall spinner idea is interesting and it's new for the seniors having this application to share the experience with other people based on the testing results.This means MusicLife has a high developing potential and it might attract our target users to use it.Compared the newest spinner design with the older version, our team had found out current design with play music, record and likes button is easy enough for users to navigate it.However, not only the users but Lorna as well had mentioned that current application design is not fully implemented as the music content is hidden so deep and it doesn't reflect that this application is used for sharing the experience of music which cause the confusions.To make the application more music related,we might need to bring out the music square first rather than event square.For example,after chosing the desired emotion to start sharing,music related to selected emotion should be displayed like a post and allowing people to listen to that pieces at the application.
