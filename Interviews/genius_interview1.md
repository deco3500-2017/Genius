## Preliminary interviews to gather insights and requirements 
This interview session was carried out in the beginning when we decided to create a platform to let elders share music ,record music and share stories through App.We also created a paper prototype to collect users views.Our team believed that it gets easy to explain the concept to elders if we have some proof in hand. It becomes easy to collect views from showing protototype rather than just telling about it.
### Planning
Before we could start creating Music app for elders , we decided to interview elders to find out their views about the app. Also to aid us in designing, we needed to find out what technology and app they are currently using .Followings are the questions we asked in the first interview:
* Do you have any mobile devices?
* How do you utilize your devices? Do you use it to listen to music?
* Do you like listening to music?
* What role does it play in your life?
* How often do you use your phone to listen to music?
* How long do you listen to music per day?
* What type of music do you like?
* What platform do you use for approaching music?TV,radio or smart phone?
* What is your most favourite music application and state why.
* Do you like to share music with others? If yes, when you sharing the music, what kind of message are you trying to deliver?
* What kind of music application you preferred? Why?
* What is your favourite song?
* Do you have children? Do you have same listening topic or interest with them?
* How do you want to share music? Record? Listening? Or repost others?
**About Paper Prototype**
* What do you think of this design?What do you think it is trying to deliver?
* Do you think you would need to learn or Is it easy for you to use it?
* For the sharing page,what will you design to make the process more clearer?
* If buttons, images and screen layouts are clear and easy to use?

## Summary
Based on the gathered results, we found out that the majority of the seniors have their own smartphone and they use their phone mainly for sending messages, making phone calls and reading some news on.However, they seldom use the smartphone for listening music due to some reasons.For example, Xu who is a 65 years old lady born in Hong Kong but living in Brisbane for more than 30 years preferred listening CD music rather than online music because she only gets 3GB mobile data monthly and she doesn't want to pay the extra fee for the data.Another gentleman Kiwi, ages 72 saying he dislikes music applications as he has some technical problems on creating his person playlist.But he likes listening to whatever music played on the radio because he doesn't need to worry about interrupting his work on changing music.Not only Kiwi but most of our participants express their preference on listening music through CD and radio channels.

However, some of them expressed going to church to listening carol is their major platform of approaching music but they are willing to use a mobile music application to share their favorite songs and stories with their family and friends as well to keep the relationship closer.They also suggested making the application easy to use by using some simple motions such as dragging, clicking and swapping.In addition, big text and big buttons are important for seniors and Liang another 72 years old lady said that she actually didn't care about the interface is fancy or not and she is more focus how easy the application is to use and understand.She also indicated that using the design of some tropical daily items can help them get familiar with the application which means it should look like an actual item.For example, simulating a radio design for playing music is easy for them understanding how to change the song or channel.

Through the interview, we have found the elderly in this age, do not want to learn something new . Relative to the mobile phone software, they are more inclined to use their familiar equipment to listen to music, such as Lanpo like watching TV, listening to Peking opera from the TV. Jan likes to buy a disc, use a CD player to listen to symphony.
So through interviews, we found that if you want to design music device for the elderly group,we need to consider the actual needs,interests and habits of the elderly.
