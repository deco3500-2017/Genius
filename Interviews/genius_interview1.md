## Summary
Based on the gathered results, we found out that the majority of the seniors have their own smartphone and they use their phone mainly for sending messages, making phone calls and reading some news on.However, they seldom use the smartphone for listening music due to some reasons.For example, Xu who is a 65 years old lady born in Hong Kong but living in Brisbane for more than 30 years preferred listening CD music rather than online music because she only gets 3GB mobile data monthly and she doesn't want to pay the extra fee for the data.Another gentleman Kiwi, ages 72 saying he dislikes music applications as he has some technical problems on creating his person playlist.But he likes listening to whatever music played on the radio because he doesn't need to worry about interrupting his work on changing music.Not only Kiwi but most of our participants express their preference on listening music through CD and radio channels.

However, some of them express going to church to listening carol is their major platform of approaching music but they are willing to use a mobile music application to share their favorite songs and stories with their family and friends as well to keep the relationship closer.They also suggested making the application easy to use by using some simple motions such as dragging, clicking and swapping.In addition, big text and big buttons are important for seniors and Liang another 72 years old lady said that she actually didn't care about the interface is fancy or not and she is more focus how easy the application is to use and understand.She also indicated that using the design of some tropical daily items can help them get familiar with the application which means it should look like an actual item.For example, simulating a radio design for playing music is easy for them understanding how to change the song or channel.
