The intervies were conducted to research if elders prefer sharing their stories online or face to face.To progress with the additional features that let user create events and share their stories with other peolpe, it was necessary to know if elders like to talk to strangers and how important is being social in their lives.The aim of interviews was to find out what will help them develop relationships and getting social with strangers through music.

The second person we interviewed likes listening to music but prefers reading over music. He likes listening to Folks and blues. He is in his late 70's, retired from Army but still unmarried.He has got very few friends and do not like meeting people. To him the importance of having such app is just reading others stories. He enjoys reading a lot and that is his favourite pass time.From this interview I concluded that we must keep the feature of recording stories and sharing them online for those people who are alone to enjoy and learn from others.

Mr.Badi, an Indonesian Chinese who is at the age around 68 said he didn't listen to music anymore as he was being old and he admitted that music reminds his past memory.He prefers face-to-face communication rather than online and he doesn't mind talking and share his life story with strangers unless they're in the same community.

Also, he has a collection of music with chants and choral singing to graceful action songs and ferocious war dances.Even now he cannot dance like before, but likes playing that music as he believes that music has emotions that can let anyone stamp foot and slap thigh thus encouraging physical movement. He would like to share his collection and stories with people to initiate physical movements and spread their Kiwi culture.
