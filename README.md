## Introduction
MusicLife is an application that aims to provide a social platform for elders to share their life story or music experience with other people through  physical events.As music has a strong connection with human memory, music will be used as a support tool to help seniors recalling their memory and also as an ice-breaking tool.Since human beings are actually the witness of the development of human society, the life story or music experience of every human being is valuable for researchers on teasing out the development of human society and saving some traditional music.By doing this, seniors can still contribute to current society and find out their values.

## Research
### Academic Studies
Through the research of the trends and features of the elderly in Australia of using digital communication methods, there are 
some evidence shows the Australian elderly would like to download applications on phones than before, they use devices which
provide online service more frequently, and they are more likely to choose phones for online surfing (“Australians’ digital lives”, 2015). 

Music is an important part which can provide old people benefits for life quality  by contributing to positive self-esteem, by helping people feel competent and independent, and by lessening feelings of isolation and loneliness. (Hays &  Minichiello, 2005). By sharing and participating of music, the seniors could feel joyful and enjoyable, release stress and receive positive emotions ( Lehmberg & Fung, 2010). Since physical, psychological and social areas are defined as major components of quality of life (Kane, 2001), it is logical to conclude that active music participation and sharing has a positive effect on the quality of life of senior citizens.

How is music impacts human`s Brain, Emotions and memories
 
From the drumbeats of our ancient ancestors to today’s unlimited streaming services, music is an integral part of the human experience. Music is a common phenomenon that crosses all borders of culture, nationality and race. Music is a tool for inspiring memories, emotions and feelings. Music has more powerful than language. Music can be thought of as a type of perceptual illusion, much the same way in which a collage is perceived. As evidence that humans are the principal source of emotionality among human and artifacts, consider human visual signs.
 
According to a large number of data survey shows that everyone has heard a certain period or a familiar music and then aroused a memory or emotional experience. When people hear familiar music, memory and music will resonate. People's emotions tend to be with the ups and downs of music and the lyrics of the content, resulting in different mood ups and downs with different memories. So many people listen to music at the same time, will be accompanied by their own emotions, and understanding of the lyrics.
 
With the increase in human age, emotional needs will gradually increase. So many elderly people in the emotional needs of the very large, they are more likely than young people because of music, a familiar melody and into memory. So the elderly are very accustomed to repeatedly listen to their young when popular music.
 
Older people rarely chase new music and songs like young people, and the reason is that these new songs cannot awaken their memories and old stories.

### Published Data
15% of elderly whose are 65 years old or above in USA has used streaming music app to listen music (Music Machinery, nd). Comapare to 13-34 years old age group, they have around 40-50% of population that will use music streaming apps to listen music. But still, 15% is still a massive number in the elderly population.

The top artists for the average 64-year-old listener include a mix of currently popular artists along with a number of artists from years gone by ((Music Machinery, nd), however, the article pointed out that 13 years old listener only listen to current artist, which means elderly have more acceptance to the modern music.

### Primary Data:
Definition of elders:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age
The definition of seniors are different based on the location around the world.The the World Health Organization (WHO) set 50 as the beginning of old age while the United Nations has agreed that 60+ years may be usually denoted as old age[9] and this is the first attempt at an international definition of old age.

Brain-music connection:https://musicandmemory.org/about/brain-music-connection/
https://musicandmemory.org/music-brain-resources/music-and-the-brain/

In fact, our brains are hardwired to connect music with long-term memory.Even for persons with severe dementia, music can tap deep emotional recall. For individuals suffering from Alzheimer’s, memory for things—names, places, facts—is compromised, but memories from our teenage years can be well-preserved.


## Concept
### Problem Domain
### Demographic
Definition of elders:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age
Most developed-world countries have accepted the chronological age of 65 years as a definition of 'elderly' or older person. The United Nations has agreed that 60+ years may be usually denoted as old age[9] and this is the first attempt at an international definition of old age. However, for its study of old age in Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) set 50 as the beginning of old age. At the same time, the WHO recognized that the developing world often defines old age, not by years, but by new roles, loss of previous roles, or inability to make active contributions to society.[10]

For the study of old age in Africa,the World Health Organization set 50 as the beginning of old age. However,the definition of seniors is slightly different among developing countries and developed countries according to the Wikipedia.The majority of developed-world countries have agreed that senior citizens are those people with the chronological age of 65 years while citizens with age 60+ will be considered as seniors in most developed countries.Based on this situation,the application MusicLife will use Australian senior difinition as our target audience group which is people with the age of 60+ and do not work full time.

***What will Elders do?***
1.   Play music
2.   Read others stories.
3.   Share their own stories.

**Focused Groups:**

*Elders above age 60:*
There have been numerous music apps available but that have not been designed in keeping in mind that elders do have health related issues that can make it difficult for them to use those apps. We try to find out what difficulties do they find and what features would they like to be implemented in Music app.

*Elders living apart from Family:*
Our main focus is to let elders share their music and memories with their families and friends. Most of the elders are found living apart from families. We want to provide them a platform to share their Memories and stories with a particular song with their families and friends and stay connected. Elders feel loved when someone listens and appreciates them. Also recalling memories help them overcome Dementia.Music can trigger long forgotten memories and reduce anxiety. Music has been proven to promote better health and a higher level of functioning.

*Elders who like music:*
We need to test music apps with the group of elders who are fond of music and can be the potential users. Elders who like music will possibly be using some source of  music and can help us understand their needs and problems they have been facing in the current app or devices.

*Elders who are currently using Music Apps:*
As we are required to design app , we must know what apps are being used by our elders and what do they like or hate about their current apps. This will help us know the layout, features and design properties they are comfortable with.

***How are functions related to each other?***




***What information needs to be available?***           
***Data required to perform task:***
                
            

***Form of the solution -*** This Music app will be an interactive app with Icons, menus and clear text on Pages that can be swiped  to navigate through app.
