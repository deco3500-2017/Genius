# MusicLife Design Documentation Report

## Introduction
MusicLife is an application that aims to provide a social platform for elders to share their life story or music experience with other people through  physical events.As music has a strong connection with human memory, music will be used as a support tool to help seniors recalling their memory and also as an ice-breaking tool.Since human beings are actually the witness of the development of human society, the life story or music experience of every human being is valuable for researchers on teasing out the development of human society and saving some traditional music.By doing this, seniors can still contribute to current society and find out their values.

## Research
### Academic Studies
Music is an important part which can provide old people benefits for life quality by contributing to positive self-esteem, by helping people feel competent and independent, and by lessening feelings of isolation and loneliness (Hays &  Minichiello, 2005). By sharing and participating of music, the seniors could feel joyful and enjoyable, release stress and receive positive emotions (Lehmberg & Fung, 2010). Since physical, psychological and social areas are defined as major components of quality of life (Kane, 2001), it is logical to conclude that active music participation and sharing has a positive effect on the quality of life of senior citizens.

According to a large number of data survey shows that everyone has heard a certain period or a familiar music and then aroused a memory or emotional experience. When people hear familiar music, memory and music will resonate. People's emotions tend to be with the ups and downs of music and the lyrics of the content, resulting in different mood ups and downs with different memories. So many people listen to music at the same time, will be accompanied by their own emotions, and understanding of the lyrics.
 
With the increase in human age, emotional needs will gradually increase. So many elderly people in the emotional needs of the very large, they are more likely than young people because of music, a familiar melody and into memory. So the elderly are very accustomed to repeatedly listen to their young when popular music.

Through the research of the trends and features of the elderly in Australia of using digital communication methods, there are 
some evidence shows the Australian elderly would like to download applications on phones than before, they use devices which
provide online service more frequently, and they are more likely to choose phones for online surfing (“Australians’ digital lives”, 2015). What's more, older people rarely chase new music and songs like young people, and the reason is that these new songs cannot awaken their memories and old stories.

In terms of the impacts of human's brains, emotions and memories by music, there are some valuable findings. From the drumbeats of our ancient ancestors to today’s unlimited streaming services, music is an integral part of the human experience. Music is a common phenomenon that crosses all borders of culture, nationality and race. Music is a tool for inspiring memories, emotions and feelings. Music has more powerful than language. Music can be thought of as a type of perceptual illusion, much the same way in which a collage is perceived. As evidence that humans are the principal source of emotionality among human and artifacts, consider human visual signs.

### Primary Data:
The definition of seniors are different based on the location around the world.The the World Health Organization set 50 as the beginning of old age while the United Nations has agreed that 60+ years may be usually denoted as old age and this is the first attempt at an international definition of old age (En.wikipedia.org, 2017).

In fact, our brains are hardwired to connect music with long-term memory.Even for persons with severe dementia, music can tap deep emotional recall. For individuals suffering from Alzheimer’s, memory for things—names, places, facts—is compromised, but memories from our teenage years can be well-preserved (Sacks, 2007).

### Published Data
15% of elderly whose are 65 years old or above in USA has used streaming music app to listen music. Comapare to 13-34 years old age group, they have around 40-50% of population that will use music streaming apps to listen music. But still, 15% is still a massive number in the elderly population.(Music Machinery, 2017)

The top artists for the average 64-year-old listener include a mix of currently popular artists along with a number of artists from years gone by ((Music Machinery, nd), however, the article pointed out that 13 years old listener only listen to current artist, which means elderly have more acceptance to the modern music.(Music Machinery, 2017)

## Concept
### Problem Domain
Music offers a multitude of benefits for people of every age, particularly for the elderly population. It works as a therapy to increase memory function, relax the body, reduce muscle tension and boost productivity. Our idea is to create a music app especially for elders to help them listen to music and share their experience with the people .Along with app , we have created a spinner to help elders to meet people.It helps them recover from loneliness. Sharing stories with others gives them courage to live life when they feel being accepted and respected.Recalling memories with music can thus help them recover their speech and also overcome dementia by recalling music and stories. Singing and recording  music will  allow self-expression by sharing that with their community. The other users of the app could be the listeners who like old songs. For elders listening to music can relieve them from boredom. While listening to music , tapping foot or clapping with rhythm encourages movement. The other benefit that can be reaped is creating a large social network and recalling and sharing stories associated with the songs.Our idea to create app that help elders listen to music and create events to meet people to share stories related to the music and listen to others.



### Demographic
Most developed-world countries have accepted the chronological age of 65 years as a definition of 'elderly' or older person. The United Nations has agreed that 60+ years may be usually denoted as old age and this is the first attempt at an international definition of old age. However, for its study of old age in Africa, the World Health Organization set 50 as the beginning of old age. At the same time, the WHO recognized that the developing world often defines old age, not by years, but by new roles, loss of previous roles, or inability to make active contributions to society. (En.wikipedia.org, 2017)

For the study of old age in Africa,the World Health Organization set 50 as the beginning of old age. However,the definition of seniors is slightly different among developing countries and developed countries according to the Wikipedia (En.wikipedia.org, 2017).The majority of developed-world countries have agreed that senior citizens are those people with the chronological age of 65 years while citizens with age 60+ will be considered as seniors in most developed countries.Based on this situation,the application MusicLife will use Australian senior difinition as our target audience group which is people with the age of 60+ and do not work full time.

## Conceptual Model:

***Functions of the App:***
1. It includes various songs categorised according to the mood.Elders would be required to tap the mood they are in or they want to listen to music.
2. It lists the popular songs  under the mood with their ranking and number of likes.
3. Elders  can play music.It has functions to play,pause,stop,reverse and forward music.
4. It will help elders to see the events under that song .Events are mood specif rather than particular song specific.Aim is to help eldely in same mood to get together to share stories for same mood and inspire each other.
5. App will help elderly to create event too. They need to mention date,time, venue ,title and desccription about the event
6. It will help  elders add their pictures and music to be used at event.
7. App can display the list of events joined by the user.
8.The list of events sorts the events according to the distance.Elders can not travel long distance.Keeping in mind the App displays the nearest event first.

***Functions of the spinner***
Spinner will be used at events by elders to share their songs, like others songs,record their stories or songs and then listen to them.
1. Music added to the app can be played with the spinner.
2. It displays the name of each Partion , with their music updated automatically by the app.
3. It helps in turn taking.
4. It has like button to like others stories.
5. It has a record button to record voice.
6. It has Play button to play the music.
7. It has button to play recording too.

***What will Elders do?***
1. Play music
2. Read others stories.
3. Share their own stories.
4. Look for events near them.
5. Register to attend existing event.
6. Create event of their interest.
7. Upload music,images to share on event.
8. Listen to music categorised according to mood.
9. Meet others during events, helping them grow socially.
10. Take turns to express their emotions.
11.  Record their Music or play music using Spinner during Event.

*** How are Function related to each other ***
The aim of App and spinner is to help elderly share their memories when trigerred while listening to music and meet people with the same interests for the music who are also eager to meet others and share stories with each other. The functions are related to each other in the app. One need to listen to the music under their selected mood. The more tab unser the songs will display the events related to that music.Join event tab is also under the song.If they do not find any event of their interest and wish to create their own,that function is available under that particular song. The following diagram shows how functions are related to each other:



***What information needs to be available?***           

**Data required to perform task:**

Data required to run the app: The most important data is music.Various music of interests and particularly that had been famous atleast 50 years ago. Selection of songs should be such to trigger memories or inspire elders to say something.Music has to be from most of the categories that had been in trend and famous during our their time.Most of the memories are from childhood, young age ,when they got married, had kids or grand children.So songs have to be during that era from all those occassions.

**How are data transformed by system?**

Initial data is the Music that must be updated in the app time to time . 
App needs to take the location of the elder to search for events near them.
App sends data like name, song to the Spinner.
Spinner displays names of the person attending event together and help them in talking turns.
      
**Form of the solution**
MusicLife appp will be an interactive app with Icons, menus and clear text on Pages that can be swiped  to navigate through app.
Spinner has easy touch interactions to play ,record and like.

Level of user support - App and spinner both are simple and easy to use. Elders won't be required to learn something new. The buttons are similar to the existing apps and interactions.

Activity to be supported -Helping elders to come together share their emotion snad stories with particular song.

**Focused Groups:**
*Elders above age 60:*
There have been numerous music apps available but that have not been designed in keeping in mind that elders do have health related issues that can make it difficult for them to use those apps. We try to find out what difficulties do they find and what features would they like to be implemented in Music app.

*Elders living apart from Family:*
Our main focus is to let elders share their music and memories with their families and friends. Most of the elders are found living apart from families. We want to provide them a platform to share their Memories and stories with a particular song with their families and friends and stay connected. Elders feel loved when someone listens and appreciates them. Also recalling memories help them overcome Dementia.Music can trigger long forgotten memories and reduce anxiety. Music has been proven to promote better health and a higher level of functioning.

*Elders who like music:*
We need to test music apps with the group of elders who are fond of music and can be the potential users. Elders who like music will possibly be using some source of  music and can help us understand their needs and problems they have been facing in the current app or devices.

*Elders who are currently using Music Apps:*
As we are required to design app , we must know what apps are being used by our elders and what do they like or hate about their current apps. This will help us know the layout, features and design properties they are comfortable with.

## Work in progress on Poster ##
![Poster](https://github.com/deco3500-2017/Genius/blob/master/poster.png)

Our design journey started with designing various Paper Prototypes and then selecting one out of them that is close to our requirements.

## Interview & Prototypes
Totally 2 interviews and 4 prototypes were conducted during the project MusicLife and our team had changed our original idea dramatically based on the receiving feedbacks from the prototypes and interviews.According to the difference between the previous concept and current concept, we split the whole design process into following stages.
### Stage 1
At this stage, our concept is a mobile application only, allowing seniors to share their music and the application is still a draft.Hence, we designed the first interview and paper prototype at the same time in order to figure out if the application usability is high among seniors and what kind of application or application style design they preferred.Following is the brief summary of the first interview and paper prototype:

According to the collected responses from seniors, we had found that the seniors do have their smartphone or mobile tablets but they use phones only for calling, texting and reading news purposes.The normal channel that seniors approach music is through radio, TV, CD, and church and most of them dislike listening online music due to several personal reasons.During the conversations, we also discovered the seniors would prefer to avoid using applications as they need to learn new technology but if the application is simple and easy enough for them to use, the elderly express a willingness to learn how to use it.

In terms of interface design, seniors actually didn't care about if the interface is fancy or not, they more concerned on the big buttons with clear identification.For example, a big square button with big text in it is fine for the seniors as they know what they should do for the buttons.Also,to make it more easier to navigate,simple motions can be used as gestures for the application such as clicking & dragging.However,the questions we asked during the first interview and paper prototype is on the wrong track,as the main point of the application is to allowing seniors sharing music/life experiences.

### Stage 2
In this stage,our team conducted 1 interview and 3 prototypes to implement our new spinner concept and following is the brief summary of them:

According to the interview, we had found that the seniors love to share their stories with other people, no matter strangers or not unless they show the respect of them.Also, the participants express their preference on sharing the experience through face-to-face rather than online as they indicated that body languages and eye contacts can help explaining their experience better.Based on the collected results, we found that the spinner idea is better than the previous but it still needs further details.Hence, we conducted another two prototypes that aim to figure out the spinner design.The results of the first prototype reflected that the spinner idea is great but the interface design of spinner is too complicated.Hence, we change the spinner design to only include play music, record and likes buttons.However, both of the results show that our spinner idea is not fully implemented as the music content is hidden so deep in the application.It's hard to understand what the application is used for with explanation.

## Decisions 
### Stage 1:
At the beginning after the team is formed, we were interested in the educational apps that have translate function and learn new language. However, after we did a lot of discussion and shared our idea, we find out something more interested then the translation app. At last, we decided to do a app that can share music and your own story for elderly.
### Stage 2:
Based on the receiving feedbacks from seniors, most of the seniors express their preference on an application with big texts and buttons rather than a fancy design application. Our team refined the design a little bit, big square tabs are created on top and will be used to separate different pages such as Home, Music Application, Cover Song and My favourite. Text buttons are used as main button styles instead of using icon buttons, reducing the confusions of users. In addition, download function is not taken into considerations as some seniors might not have enough mobile data to download a song or it's a bit difficult for them to learn how to download the song. To make the application easier to use, our team decided to provide online music services only and the idea of using emoji as a category is changed to using text only to separate different kinds of music. Hence, the seniors can know what kinds of music experience they are interested in easily.
 
Moreover, the purpose of our application is letting seniors share their life experience or experience on music to the strangers to contribute to current society. Our team decided to focus on the sharing aspect, but what we are concerned about is the way of sharing music/life experience. In terms of daily observation, the normal way of application sharing is posting online or leaving comments. But these kinds of ways are more used by younger generation rather than seniors. The seniors might have a huge different preference on mobile sharing. To improve the application usability, it's important to find out the sharing habits of seniors. Hence, another interview is designed to figure out what would be the best way for elderly to sharing their stories. Although the seniors indicated that they don't mind the interface design is ugly, our team still believed a clean layout design will guarantee a better user experience. Thus, in the aspect of application interface design, our team is more focus on placing elements such as buttons and tabs orderly and logically and adjusting sizes to create a clean and logic application interface. 
 
 ### Stage 3:
 After we have a conclusion at stage 2, the next step is to decide how the prototype will be done. First of all, we have sketched the paper prototype to have a rough design. After that, we need to find out which application is suitable for our team to make the digital prototype. We have few choices include Adobe XD, sketches, inVision and Unity, and our team has difficulty to make a choice between these apps because we require an app that is functional and interactive. After our tutors gave us the feedback, we decided to use Adobe XD to make the prototype base on the low learning curve and easy to use. 

### Stage 4:
Base on the user testing at the stage 3, we found out actually most of the senior is not interested in listening music, they prefer meet each other in physically. Therefore, we have changed our idea to an app that can create event and let others join. The event to let senior gathering together and share their own stories. Nevertheless, we changed our prototype to select your current emotion instead of choosing music catalog.

### Stage 5:
At first, we decided to use a digital spinner, however, the interview said they would like to use a physical spinner rather than a digital one, so we designed a spinner which is physical using paper and makeymakey to make it function.

### Stage 6:
The app was told that it cannot see the music part by tutor, it is too deep in the app to find out, so we make it clear to see it.
