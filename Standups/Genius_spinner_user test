Interface design
In the interview to the three old people, they are on the appearance of the spinner design are more satisfied, but the elderly hope that if more makes the interface more concise will be better.

"I like the spinner of your design, but it is better if you can be more concise, such as the area on each part of the keyboard is too much."

design concept
The old people expressed a high interest in our idea, and they expressed their willingness to participate in the spinner. But at the same time, they also have some confusion about this design. For example, if the choice of songs is not what they are interested or familiar with how to do? How do I join this event? Is it necessary to register or join?

"Your idea is very interesting, but in my opinion, I do not really understand how you achieve these functions."
"I think your design needs to be perfect because a lot of content makes me feel there is room for improvement and possible."
"Interesting but also confuse."

Functional design
Our group's original design concept is to use the mini project to project the spinner; the idea can make the elderly anytime, anywhere in any occasion to use. But the old man does not like the idea very much.

"I would prefer to be able to touch the physical device, such as mahjong, poker, and so on, compared to the projector."
"The physical equipment will make me more comfortable to use." The projector make me feel that the operation is not particularly comfortable.
