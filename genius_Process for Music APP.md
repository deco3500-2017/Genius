The idea for Music APP
Through the deliberations of the group, we decided that the target group was set for the elderly. We intend to do mobile music software; you can share your favorite music, mood and their own stories. Our design goal is to let the elderly also enjoy the modern technology brought convenience and fast. Help solve the elderly now face a big problem: cannot share and find their favorite music; cannot share their emotions and stories.

Design idea
Our target people are elderly, so when doing app design, we try to make the page and the function of the app simple. All the words are as large as possible selection of large fonts.
Old people in the use of our app, you can choose voice control operation. We also take into account the use of emoji alternative text classification will facilitate the use and operation of the elderly.
Such as smiling face expression of happy type of music, tears of expression on behalf of sad, melancholy songs.

Paper Prototype I
This is our group began to do the paper prototype, after the first round of the test. We found a lot of problems in our design.

Feedback from users I
	“If this software supports multiple languages will be better”
	“As far as possible with the text instead of the pattern, I do not understand what these patterns and buttons mean.”
	“I cannot understand what emoji represents, your design makes me a little confused. If the jokes of the expression of happy music, then the expression of tears on behalf of sad music? So why do I have to choose what sounds like it will make me negative music? Can these emoji into text: such as classical music, country music, opera?”
	“I am not interested in color and design style, as long as easy to understand, do not need to spend energy to learn the app, I think it is a good design.”


So according to the feedback of these users, we carried out the next stage of the changes and improvements.

Feedback from tutor I
Tutor gave us a lot of suggestions. We intend to follow our tutor's advice for our next stage of improvement.
	Our target group is not clear enough, what is the definition of the elderly? Is there a specific age stage?
	There are many problems with our questionnaires. The question of most questionnaires is focused on asking whether the interviewee has experienced the use of the mobile phone, what songs to listen to with the mobile phone, and so on, to pay too much attention to the function of sharing music, while ignoring the interaction Emotions and memories of the elements.
	The target theme is not clear enough


Paper Prototype II
Through the group discussion, and summed up the results of various feedback, we improved the prototype.

Then we also made a digital prototype, began a new round of user testing. In the course of the test we found a huge problem.

Feedback from users II
	“I must tell you the truth, I am a person who does not love the phone, because I really do not know how to use smart phones.”
	“I never use a smartphone.”
	“Compared to the use of smart phones to listen to music, I am more accustomed to listening to music on television.”
	“Take the radio to listen to music is the way I used to, mobile phone software for me is too difficult.”

Summary

According to our group's repeated discussions, user feedback and follow the tutor's advice. We decided to completely put our original idea of designing app into a more suitable to meet the habits of the elderly equipment.
So after our further discussion and discussion, we came up with a lot of ideas, and finally we decided to do a "spinner", in a way of the game, let the elderly share music, tell their own stories and interact with others.
