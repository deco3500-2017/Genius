##Introduction

##Research
### Academic Studies
Through the research of the trends and features of the elderly in Australia of using digital communication methods, there are 
some evidence shows the Australian elderly would like to download applications on phones than before, they use devices which
provide online service more frequently, and they are more likely to choose phones for online surfing (“Australians’ digital lives”, 2015). 

Music is an important part which can provide old people benefits for life quality  by contributing to positive self-esteem, by helping people feel competent and independent, and by lessening feelings of isolation and loneliness. (Hays &  Minichiello, 2005). By sharing and participating of music, the seniors could feel joyful and enjoyable, release stress and receive positive emotions ( Lehmberg & Fung, 2010). Since physical, psychological and social areas are defined as major components of quality of life (Kane, 2001), it is logical to conclude that active music participation and sharing has a positive effect on the quality of life of senior citizens.

### Published Data
###Primary Data:
Definition of elders:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age
The definition of seniors are different based on the location around the world.The the World Health Organization (WHO) set 50 as the beginning of old age while the United Nations has agreed that 60+ years may be usually denoted as old age[9] and this is the first attempt at an international definition of old age.

Brain-music connection:https://musicandmemory.org/about/brain-music-connection/

In fact, our brains are hardwired to connect music with long-term memory.Even for persons with severe dementia, music can tap deep emotional recall. For individuals suffering from Alzheimer’s, memory for things—names, places, facts—is compromised, but memories from our teenage years can be well-preserved.

### Interviews:
Before we could start creating Music app for elders , we decided to interview elders to find out their views about the app. Also to aid us in designing, we needed to find out what technology and app they are currently using .The  questions that were framed to be asked were:
Do you have smart phones?
What activities do you do on your phone?
Do you listen to Music?
Do you sing Music?
What kind of Music do you like?
What device do you use to play music?
What is your preferred device for music and why?
Do you use any app to listen to music?
What role does Music play in your life?
Any health related issues.
How comfortable are you with current apps and devices.

Focused Groups:

Elders above age 60: There have been numerous music apps available but that have not been designed in keeping in mind that elders do have health related issues that can make it difficult for them to use those apps. We try to find out what difficulties do they find and what features would they like to be implemented in Music app.

Elders living apart from Family.Our main focus is to let elders share their music and memories with their families and friends. Most of the elders are found living apart from families. We want to provide them a platform to share their Memories and stories with a particular song with their families and friends and stay connected. Elders feel loved when someone listens and appreciates them. Also recalling memories help them overcome Dementia.Music can trigger long forgotten memories and reduce anxiety. Music has been proven to promote better health and a higher level of functioning.

Elders who like music: We need to test music apps with the group of elders who are fond of music and can be the potential users. Elders who like music will possibly be using some source of  music and can help us understand their needs and problems they have been facing in the current app or devices.

Elders who are currently using Music Apps:As we are required to design app , we must know what apps are being used by our elders and what do they like or hate about their current apps. This will help us know the layout, features and design properties they are comfortable with.


Interviews :

Interview 1: This interviewee is a french lady who is 68 years old and lives with husband in Gold Coast. She has her kids settled in New Zealand. She uses smartphone to call , facebook and play games . She likes playing games that involves drag and dropping and thus do not like playing on desktop. She cannot sit for long time thus likes using mobile as it can be used anywhere , anytime and anyway.She likes listening radio. She would want an app to help her sing Birthday, christmas and new year  messages and sending it to family. She uses Youtube to listen to music.

Interview 2: He is Kiwi, age 72  and has been living in Gold Coast for nearly 20 years. He is not very expert in technology. He is building manager and only uses mobile to call and send messages. He uses desktop to create documents and send emails due to big screen. He says that he avoid using mobile due to small letters or interface. He watches TV and listens Radio too. As he do not like using phone to listen to music as it involves changing music and he don’t know how to create playlists. He likes whatever is played on radio and then he don't need to change anything interrupting his work.He likes playing music than singing. Also , he would like playing music of his time. When asked , if he would like to use app that helps him listen to music and share that with friends and family ,he responded that only if it is very easy and simple to use and contains bigger fonts.

Interview 3: He is  retired , age 76  and very proficient user and also knows how to create apps and websites. He likes sports and music . He uses iphone to connect with family using facebook and skype. He do not like writing messages but instead uses sending voice messages or making call. He feels that voice helps you recognise emotions of others and also help others conveying your emotions with messages more effectively than writing text. When asked about our Music app , he said that it is great idea and he would like to sing and share music and stories with grandchildren if we have options to record stories in his voice. Currently , he has been using skype to share his cooking with grandchildren.Also , suggested to put options that enable us to select from various option rather than inputting text.



##Requirements
Based , on our  research , we have found that elders do not like to use complex apps and avoid using devices and apps that involves too many interactions. They do have stories related to music which triggers when particular song is playing but haven’t found any platform that lets them share that with their friends and families staying apart. So our aim is to develop an app with the following considerations in mind:


Elderly prefer using larger font size and clear interface. They avoid to use apps that has complicated interface and it makes hard to look at. In other words, they don’t need the interface has good looking, they can stay the interface as clear as it can.
Icon can help them use the app more efficient. (icon not emoji) 
Elderly prefer to choose a song per page rather than a list. By which they mean little details associated with it and may be little part of song than just the name of the song.
Avoid to  scroll a list.
They do not have patient to download a song.
They want some apps that is classic, apps found today are  too modern for elderly.
They want the app has multi language option.
The interface metaphor must as clear and accurate as it can, otherwise it will confuse them.
App that allows to record and share .
App that does not require too much interactions playing music.
They like Auto Playlists.
